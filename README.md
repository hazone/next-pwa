# next-pwa

This is a Progressive Web App built with React. Main features include -

- Server-side rendering and code splitting (using next)

- Better Server-rendering performance due to component-caching (using lru-cache)

- Offline-support with Service Worker (thanks to workbox)

- Purging unused CSS (thanks to PurifyCSS)

Many more minor wins here and there.

Also used Spectre.css for styling (don't worry about size unused CSS selectors are trimmed away remember)
